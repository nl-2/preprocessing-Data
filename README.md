# Data Preprocessing Project

## Overview
This project includes data preprocessing steps using Python and Google Colab. The goal is to prepare and analyze data in a way that makes it easy to use for analytical or training models.

## Installation
### Requirements
- **Google Account**: Required to use Google Colab.
- **Google Colab**: To run the project through a Notebook interface.

No need to install libraries on your device, as Google Colab comes with most common libraries pre-installed. However, some additional libraries may be installed directly within the Notebook as needed.

## Usage
To run the project on Google Colab:

1. **Open the File**:  
   - Upload the `preprosseing.ipynb` file to your Google Drive.
   - Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your browser, then select "Open from Google Drive" to open the file.

2. **Set Up the Environment and Run Cells**:  
   - Once the file is open in Google Colab, run each cell sequentially.
   - Make sure to review cells that install libraries or load data, then continue running the rest of the steps until preprocessing is complete.

3. **Execute Preprocessing Steps**:  
   - The Notebook contains code specifically for data preprocessing. Follow the instructions within the file to understand the preprocessing operations and how to customize them as needed.

## Data
To load data in Google Colab, you can:
- **Upload data from your device**: Use code to upload files directly from your device to Colab.
- **Google Drive**: Link Google Colab to your Google Drive account to access files directly from Google Drive.

Steps for loading data are explained in the `preprosseing.ipynb` file.
